# Deep_learning_course_work
Repository housing my scripts running through the deep learning course

## To do:
- Need to add Mnist examples using a CNN perceptron layout
- Need to test and compare tabular prediction of MLP model with a similarly validated random forest, GBM and XGBoost model using crossvalidation on the iris dataset
